**"ai đó" = who’s there?"** (Vietnamese)  
**"AI-Do" = AI does it.**

_Aido_ is a shell-based assistant that helps you generate and understand problems from **Theory of Computation** — from DFAs to CFGs to PDAs and beyond.

Built by **Michael Nguyen** with the help of **GPT**, `aido` is your personalized ToC tutor in the terminal.

## 🚀 What It Does

- ✅ DFA transition tables + diagrams  
- ✅ CFGs and CNF conversions  
- ✅ PDA construction + stack behavior  
- ✅ Parse trees (ASCII + LaTeX/TikZ)  
- ✅ Step-by-step derivations  
- ✅ Quiz and explanation generation

./aido.sh "Design a DFA for strings ending in ab"
./aido.sh "Give a CFG for the language { aⁿbⁿ | n ≥ 0 }"
./aido.sh "Convert the CFG S → ASA | aB to CNF"
./aido.sh "Draw a parse tree for ababcc"
./aido.sh "Design a PDA for palindromes over {a,b}"
